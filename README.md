# ECE-2524-Project-3
For Project 3, I developed a Python program called manip.py that
manipulates files via command-line arguments.

The program runs via Python and is executed by calling
"python manip.py &lt;OPERATION&rt; &lt;PARAMETERS&rt; lt;FILE&rt;" where OPERATION
is the intended operation to perform on FILE and PARAMETERS vary
depending on which operation is selected.
